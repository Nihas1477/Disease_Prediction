# Disease Prediction

A machine learning-based project to predict diseases based on input symptoms. This project leverages data-driven insights to assist in preliminary disease diagnosis, helping users understand potential health issues quickly.

## Features
- Input symptoms and receive predictions of possible diseases.
- Utilizes machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Interactive user interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for building machine learning models
- Flask for the web framework
- HTML and CSS for front-end

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nihas1477/Disease_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Disease_Prediction
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your web browser and visit:
   ```plaintext
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains various symptoms mapped to their respective diseases. This dataset is processed and used to train machine learning models for predictions.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the user interface.
- `static/`: Contains static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `model/`: Trained machine learning model files.
- `data/`: Dataset used for training and testing.
